# 🎮 GameBox - Community Gaming Platform

## 📖 About
GameBox is a browser-based gaming platform that allows users to play games either solo or with friends — created by you or by other players.  
This project was built during my free time out of passion for crafting engaging web experiences and exploring new technologies.

---

- **AI Assistance:**  
  - 90% built with [Stitch AI](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/)  
  - 10% built with DeepSeek AI  
  - ~99% of code generated with AI assistance  
- **Code Comments:** Mixed languages (English, Turkish, Azerbaijani)

## 🎯 Project Vision
While this project is currently a **frontend-only demo**, the goal is to transform it into a **fully functional full-stack platform** once financial resources make server acquisition feasible.  
The project structure is intentionally designed to support **future backend integration** and **community contributions**.

---

- **State Management:** `localStorage` (client-side simulation)  
- **Backend:** None (purely client-side implementation)

---

## 🔮 Future Possibilities
This project serves as a foundation that could be enhanced with:
- Real backend infrastructure  
- User authentication system  
- Live multiplayer functionality  
- Game upload & sharing features  
- Payment integration for premium games  
- Community & social interaction features

## 💡 Developer's Note
This project represents my passion for creating visually appealing and functional web applications.  
While it has limitations in its current form, it demonstrates the potential for what could become a fully-featured gaming platform with community support and proper backend development.
